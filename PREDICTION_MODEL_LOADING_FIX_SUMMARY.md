# Prediction Model Loading Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The prediction system was failing with the error:
```
2025-06-28 20:38:14,250 - stock_prediction_gui.core.prediction_integration - ERROR - Prediction failed: No model weights found in /Users/porupine/Desktop/revised_neural_net/model_20250628_203753/stock_model.npz
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `stock_prediction_gui/core/prediction_integration.py` file. The code was incorrectly trying to call `StockNet.load_weights()` as an **instance method** on an existing model instance:

```python
# INCORRECT - This was causing the error
model = StockNet(input_size, hidden_size, 1)
model.load_weights(model_file)  # ❌ Wrong! This method doesn't exist
```

However, `StockNet.load_weights()` is actually a **class method** that returns a new model instance:

```python
# CORRECT - This is how it should be used
model = StockNet.load_weights(model_dir, prefix="stock_model")  # ✅ Returns new model instance
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Model Loading Logic

Updated the prediction integration code to use the class method correctly:

```python
# Before (incorrect)
model = StockNet(input_size, hidden_size, 1)
model.load_weights(model_file)

# After (correct)
model = StockNet.load_weights(model_dir, prefix="stock_model")
```

### 2. Enhanced Model File Detection

Improved the model file detection logic to handle different file naming patterns:

```python
# Load model using the class method with the found file
model = StockNet.load_weights(model_dir, prefix=os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(model_file_found))[0])
```

### 3. Fixed Model Parameter Extraction

Updated the `_extract_model_parameters` method to correctly extract weights from StockNet models:

```python
# For basic StockNet models
if hasattr(model, 'W1') and hasattr(model, 'W2'):
    # StockNet stores weights as W1, W2, b1, b2
    weights = np.concatenate([model.W1.flatten(), model.W2.flatten()])
    bias = np.concatenate([model.b1.flatten(), model.b2.flatten()])
    return weights, bias
```

## Files Modified

1. **`stock_prediction_gui/core/prediction_integration.py`**
   - Fixed model loading logic in `_prediction_worker` method
   - Updated `_extract_model_parameters` method for StockNet compatibility

## Testing

Created and ran comprehensive tests to verify the fix:

```bash
python test_prediction_fix.py
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Model loading test passed
- ✅ Prediction integration test passed
- ✅ Model prediction functionality working correctly

## Verification

The fix was verified by:

1. **Model Loading**: Successfully loading the problematic model (`model_20250628_203753`)
2. **Weight Extraction**: Correctly extracting weights and biases from the loaded model
3. **Prediction**: Making successful predictions with the loaded model
4. **Integration**: Ensuring the prediction integration module works correctly

## Impact

This fix resolves the prediction system failure and allows users to:

- ✅ Load trained models correctly
- ✅ Make predictions on new data
- ✅ Use the prediction visualization features
- ✅ Access all prediction functionality in the GUI

## Technical Details

### StockNet Model Structure

The StockNet model stores weights in the following format:
- `W1`: Input to hidden layer weights (shape: input_size × hidden_size)
- `b1`: Hidden layer biases (shape: 1 × hidden_size)
- `W2`: Hidden to output layer weights (shape: hidden_size × 1)
- `b2`: Output layer biases (shape: 1 × 1)

### Class Method vs Instance Method

The key distinction that was causing the issue:

```python
# Class method (correct usage)
model = StockNet.load_weights(model_dir, prefix="stock_model")

# Instance method (incorrect - doesn't exist)
model = StockNet(input_size, hidden_size, 1)
model.load_weights(model_file)  # This method doesn't exist
```

## Conclusion

The prediction system is now fully functional and can correctly load trained models for making predictions. The fix addresses the fundamental issue of incorrect method usage and ensures compatibility with the StockNet model architecture.
