# Forward Pass Visualizer Numpy Array Formatting Fix

## Issue Description

The forward pass visualizer was encountering formatting errors when trying to display numpy arrays in the information panel:

```
2025-06-28 23:34:58,682 - stock_prediction_gui.ui.widgets.forward_pass_visualizer - ERROR - Visualization update error: unsupported format string passed to numpy.ndarray.__format__
```

## Root Cause

The error occurred in the `update_info()` method of `ForwardPassVisualizer` when trying to format numpy arrays with the `.4f` format string. The issue happened when:

1. **Prediction values** were numpy arrays instead of scalars
2. **Weight values** were numpy arrays instead of scalars  
3. **Bias values** were numpy arrays instead of scalars

The code was trying to apply format strings like `{recent_pred:.4f}` directly to numpy arrays, which is not supported.

## Solution

Modified the `update_info()` method in `stock_prediction_gui/ui/widgets/forward_pass_visualizer.py` to properly handle numpy arrays by extracting scalar values before formatting:

### Before (Problematic Code):
```python
if len(self.prediction_history) > 0:
    recent_pred = self.prediction_history[-1]
    info_parts.append(f"Latest: {recent_pred:.4f}")  # Error if recent_pred is numpy array

if len(self.bias_history) > 0:
    recent_bias = self.bias_history[-1]
    info_parts.append(f"Bias: {recent_bias:.4f}")  # Error if recent_bias is numpy array
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```python
if len(self.prediction_history) > 0:
    recent_pred = self.prediction_history[-1]
    # Handle numpy arrays by extracting scalar value
    if hasattr(recent_pred, 'item'):
        recent_pred = recent_pred.item()
    elif hasattr(recent_pred, '__len__') and len(recent_pred) > 0:
        recent_pred = recent_pred[0]
    info_parts.append(f"Latest: {recent_pred:.4f}")

if len(self.bias_history) > 0:
    recent_bias = self.bias_history[-1]
    # Handle numpy arrays by extracting scalar value
    if hasattr(recent_bias, 'item'):
        recent_bias = recent_bias.item()
    elif hasattr(recent_bias, '__len__') and len(recent_bias) > 0:
        recent_bias = recent_bias[0]
    info_parts.append(f"Bias: {recent_bias:.4f}")
```

## Fix Details

The fix uses two approaches to handle numpy arrays:

1. **`.item()` method**: For numpy scalar arrays (0-dimensional arrays), use `.item()` to extract the scalar value
2. **Indexing**: For 1-dimensional arrays, use `[0]` to get the first element

This ensures that all values are converted to Python scalars before applying format strings.

## Testing

Created a comprehensive test script (`test_forward_pass_visualizer_fix.py`) that verifies the fix works with:

- ✅ Regular Python scalars
- ✅ Numpy scalar arrays  
- ✅ Numpy 1D arrays
- ✅ Mixed data types
- ✅ Multiple rapid updates

## Impact

This fix resolves the formatting errors that were preventing the forward pass visualizer from properly displaying information during prediction operations. The visualizer can now handle all common data types without throwing formatting exceptions.

## Files Modified

- `stock_prediction_gui/ui/widgets/forward_pass_visualizer.py` - Fixed the `update_info()` method
- `test_forward_pass_visualizer_fix.py` - Created test script to verify the fix

## Related Issues

This fix addresses the numpy array formatting errors that were occurring during prediction operations when the forward pass visualizer was trying to display model weights, bias, and prediction values in the information panel.
