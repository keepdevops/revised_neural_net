# Gradient Descent Method Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The 3D gradient descent plot was encountering method errors when trying to extract weight values:

```
2025-06-29 00:02:51,777 - stock_prediction_gui.ui.windows.floating_3d_window - WARNING - Error extracting weight at step 0: 'GradientDescentVisualizer' object has no attribute 'extract_weight_by_index'
```

## Root Cause

The error occurred in the `create_3d_gradient_descent_plot()` method of `Floating3DWindow` when trying to call `extract_weight_by_index` as a method on the `GradientDescentVisualizer` object. However, `extract_weight_by_index` is actually a standalone function, not a method of the class.

The issue happened when:
1. **Method call error**: Code was calling `gd_viz.extract_weight_by_index()` instead of the standalone function
2. **Import issue**: The standalone function wasn't being imported properly
3. **Architecture mismatch**: The function was designed as a utility function, not a class method

## Solution Applied

Modified the `create_3d_gradient_descent_plot()` method in `stock_prediction_gui/ui/windows/floating_3d_window.py`:

### 1. **Updated Import Statement**
```python
# Before
from gradient_descent_3d import GradientDescentVisualizer

# After  
from gradient_descent_3d import GradientDescentVisualizer, extract_weight_by_index
```

### 2. **Fixed Function Calls**
```python
# Before
w1_val = gd_viz.extract_weight_by_index(weight, w1_index, 'W1')
w2_val = gd_viz.extract_weight_by_index(weight, w2_index, 'W2')

# After
w1_val = extract_weight_by_index(weight, w1_index, 'W1')
w2_val = extract_weight_by_index(weight, w2_index, 'W2')
```

## Function Details

The `extract_weight_by_index` function:
- **Purpose**: Extracts specific weight values from flattened weight arrays
- **Parameters**: 
  - `weights`: Dictionary containing 'W1' and 'W2' weight arrays
  - `index`: Index of the weight to extract
  - `layer`: Which layer to extract from ('W1' or 'W2')
- **Returns**: The weight value at the specified index
- **Error Handling**: Returns 0.0 if extraction fails

## Testing Results

✅ **Function Import**: Successfully imports the standalone function  
✅ **Method Call Fix**: No longer tries to call as class method  
✅ **Weight Extraction**: Successfully extracts weight values from both mock and real data  
✅ **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles extraction errors with warnings  

## Impact

- **Fixed**: 3D gradient descent plots now work without method errors
- **Improved**: Better error handling for weight extraction
- **Maintained**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Enhanced**: More robust weight visualization in 3D plots

## Files Modified

- `stock_prediction_gui/ui/windows/floating_3d_window.py`: Fixed method calls and imports

## Test Files Created

- `test_3d_gradient_descent_fix.py`: Comprehensive test for the fix

## Usage

The 3D gradient descent visualization now works correctly:
1. Load a trained model
2. Open the 3D visualization window
3. Select "Gradient Descent" visualization type
4. View the 3D surface with gradient descent path

The fix ensures that weight extraction works properly for creating the gradient descent path visualization.
